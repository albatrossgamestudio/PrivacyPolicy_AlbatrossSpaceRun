    <h1>Privacy Policy - Space Run</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 6, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Albatross Game Studios</p>
    
    <p>This privacy policy explains how Space Run ("we," "our," or "the app") handles information when you use our mobile game, in compliance with Google Play Store policies, COPPA, GDPR, and other applicable privacy laws.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Space Run does not collect, store, process, or transmit any personal information including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Names, email addresses, or phone numbers</li>
        <li>Location data or GPS information</li>
        <li>Photos, videos, or device files</li>
        <li>Contact lists or SMS data</li>
        <li>Financial or payment information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The game functions entirely offline except for advertising services.</p>

    <h2>2. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>

    <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have inadvertently collected information from your child, please contact us immediately at albatrossgamestudio@gmail.com and we will delete such information promptly.</p>

    <h2>3. Google AdMob Integration</h2>

        <li>Device type and model</li>

        <li>App interaction data (ad views, clicks)</li>
        <li>General location (country/region level only)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> This information is collected directly by Google AdMob, not by us. We do not have access to or control over this data collection.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security and Protection</h2>
    <p>Since Space Run does not collect personal data, we do not store or transmit any sensitive information. The app operates locally on your device. All advertising-related data handling is managed securely by Google AdMob using industry-standard encryption and security measures.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>Space Run does not retain any personal data because we do not collect it. Game progress and high scores are stored locally on your device only. You can clear this data anytime by uninstalling the app.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
